[x]Your goal is to design a Multi-Agent architecture system that generates relevant AI and Generative AI (GenAI) use cases for a given Company or Industry. The system will conduct market research, understand the industry and product, and provide resource assets for AI/ML solutions, focusing on enhancing operations and customer experiences.
[x]The Multi-agent architecture must have the following agents:

Resource Asset Collection
[x]Collect the above use cases generated and search for relevant datasets on platforms like Kaggle, HuggingFace, and GitHub.
[x]Save the resource links fetched in a text or markdown file. 
[x][OPTIONAL: BONUS] If applicable, propose GenAI solutions like document search, automated report generation, and AI-powered chat systems for internal or customer-facing purposes.
[x]Final Proposal
[x]List down the top use cases that can be delivered to the customer, ensuring they are relevant to the company's goals and operational needs.
[x]Ensure to add references through which certain use cases were suggested
