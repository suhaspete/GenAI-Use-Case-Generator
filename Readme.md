Additional Resources:
You may recommend the agents to refer to reports and insights on AI and digital transformation from industry-specific sources such as McKinsey, Deloitte, or Nexocode.
Search for industry-specific use cases (e.g., “how is the retail industry leveraging AI and ML” or “AI applications in automotive manufacturing”).
Deliverables
Source code: Submit the source code of your Multi-Agentic workflow, along with any necessary scripts, configuration files, and documentation.
Report: Write a report that explains your methodology, results, and conclusions. Include anything that helps illustrate your findings. Architecture flowchart of your implementation is MUST. 
Demo Video: A video showcasing the architecture flowchart and the output generated. Bonus: Deploy the application on Streamlit or Gradio or any other relevant tools. 
Assignment Evaluation Criteria:
Your agent will be evaluated based on the following parameters:
Depth of market research and competitor analysis.
Relevance and creativity of use cases generated for the customer.
Feasibility and practicality of implementing the proposed solutions.
Quality and clarity of the final proposal, including actionable insights.
Suggested Tools & Frameworks
Agent Frameworks: Use OpenAGI, BeyondLLM, LangChain, LLamaIndex, Autogen, or CrewAI for building AI agents. You can check DeepLearning AI short courses for quick tutorials or RAG & Agents Bootcamp. 
Search & Retrieval:
Leverage Tavily or Exa or Serper for advanced web search 
Dataset Sources: Find relevant datasets on Kaggle, HuggingFace, or GitHub etc. 
Feel free to use any other tools you're comfortable with.
